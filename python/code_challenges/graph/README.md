Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods: add node, add edge, get nodes, get neighbors, size.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Review description and requirements and build to what was described. Time:O(N) Space:O(N)
