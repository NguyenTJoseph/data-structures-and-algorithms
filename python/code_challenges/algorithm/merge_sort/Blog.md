# Merge Sort
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Review the pseudocode below, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Code a working, tested implementation of Merge Sort based on the pseudocode provided.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Review description and requirements and build to what was described. Time:O(N) Space:O(1)
