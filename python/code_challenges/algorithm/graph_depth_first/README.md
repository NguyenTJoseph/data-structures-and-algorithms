# Graph Depth First
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Conduct a depth first preorder traversal on a graph

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write the following method for the Graph class:

Name: Depth first

Arguments: Node (Starting point of search)

Return: A collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order

Program output: Display the collection


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
Review description and requirements and build to what was described. Time:O(N) Space:O(N)
