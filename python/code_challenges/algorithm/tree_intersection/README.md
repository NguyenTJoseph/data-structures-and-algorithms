# Quick Sort
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Find common values in 2 binary trees.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary trees as parameters.
Using your Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.
