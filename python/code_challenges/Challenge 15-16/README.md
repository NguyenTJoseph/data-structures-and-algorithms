# Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Create a tree data structure

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create a tree data structure with pre order, in order, and post order traversals which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately. Create a Binary Search Tree class with add and contains.
